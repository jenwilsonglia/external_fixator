# NOT FOR CLINICAL USE - Orthopedic external fixator device

**This project is still under heavy development and not for clincal use**

## Introduction
External fixation devices experience a steep surge in need during
mass casualty and increased trauma situations. This project creates
a 3D printable external fixation kit that can be produced with
commodity 3D printers and easily available nuts, bolts, and metal parts.

## Acknowledgments
This project is heavily based on work by the Imperial College London team in producing a 3D-printed external fixator.

## Printing instructions
* PLA and ABS should not be used in production. Only PETG can be used.

## Assembly instructions
* Head of bolt is situated in the Hex trap of the rod clamp
* Put the pin clamp onto the bolt and secure with washer and nut on the side of the pin clamp

## Quality assurance
* Look at the [testing folder](testing) for instructions.

## Development
To open the CAD files, please use:
 * FreeCAD v1.1 (currently in Dev)
 * From "Addons", add the following:
   * Parametric Curves FP
   * Curves Workbench
