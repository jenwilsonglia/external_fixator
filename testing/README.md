# Testing protocol for plastic clamps

## Pinch test
### Why to do it
The purpose of this test is to ensure that the clamp is able to grasp the rod with simple pressure

### How to do it
1. Place the appropriately-sized rod or pin in the clamp (e.g., 8mm rod in an 8mm clamp)
2. Pinch at the middle parts of the clamp edge parallel and furthest away from the rod or pin. Ensure that this prevents 
the rod or pin from sliding and allows some grip when pulling.



## Tightening test
### Why to do it
The purpose of this test is to ensure that clamps can be tightened beyond what is expected intraoperatively without failure.

### How to do it
1. Place a bolt through the clamp piece, with a washer between the bolt head and clamp.
2. Place a nut on the other side. For pin clamps, place a washer before the nut.
3. Tighten the bolt with a torque wrench until failure. Measure failure point by incrementing torque wrench by 5-10
